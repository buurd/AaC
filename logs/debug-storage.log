    type: ""

--- Diagnosis ---
1. If you see files listed above (like 'base/', 'global/', 'pg_wal/') inside the pod,
   it means the Database is working correctly and storing data inside Minikube.

2. If your local 'production-data/webshop-db' folder is EMPTY, it means the
   'mount' between your computer and Minikube is broken or not active.

--- How to Fix ---
The most reliable way to restore the mount is to restart Minikube with the mount flag.
Run the following commands:

  minikube stop
  ./run-k8s.sh

If that doesn't work, you might need to delete and recreate the cluster (warning: deletes data):
  minikube delete
  ./run-k8s.sh
